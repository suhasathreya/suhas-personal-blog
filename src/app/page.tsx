          Hey. I&apos;m Suhas — a product and strategy guy who writes code,
          currently figuring things out in San Jose.
        </p>

        <p>
          Background: Carnegie Mellon (MISM), PwC (Salesforce dev), startup land
          (Chief of Staff at Overleap). I like building things and thinking about
          how businesses work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now I&apos;m deep into AI engineering — agents, MCP servers,
          automation, all the stuff that&apos;s actually changing how we build software.
          Not the hype. The real stuff.
        </p>

        <p>
          I read a lot. Mostly biographies (Caro&apos;s LBJ series is unmatched),
          philosophy (Alan Watts, Dao De Jing, Hindu texts), and whatever rabbit
          hole I&apos;ve fallen into that week.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually I want to start a company. For now, I&apos;m building,
          learning, and writing about it here.
